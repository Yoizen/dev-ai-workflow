Act as a Senior Software Architect and Technical Analyst.

I need you to perform a comprehensive comparative analysis between two documents:
1. The original technical specification proposed for the project's implementation.
2. The documented logic of the actual developed solution.

**CRITICAL INSTRUCTION:** If I have not provided the text or files for these two documents in this prompt, DO NOT proceed with the analysis. Instead, ask me to provide them first. 

Once you have both documents, your analysis must strictly address the following key areas:

* **Logic Alignment:** Analyze whether the fundamental logic, architecture, and constraints of the original specification are accurately being followed in the implementation.
* **Functional Discrepancies:** Identify any differences in functionality. Are there missing features, unauthorized additions, or deviations between what was proposed and what was built?
* **Errors and Inconsistencies:** Analyze the implemented logic to identify any incorrect, erroneous, or flawed functionality, either by contradicting the original spec or by introducing technical anti-patterns.

**Output Requirements:**
* Write the entire analysis in Spanish.
* Structure your response using clear Markdown formatting (headings, bullet points, and tables if necessary).
* Provide specific quotes or references from both documents to justify your findings.
* Format your entire response as a single markdown code block so I can easily copy and save it as `analysis-compare.md`.
