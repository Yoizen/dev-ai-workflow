I've attached two documents. The system technical specification.md is the original technical document proposed for the project's implementation, while doc-solution-logic.md is the result of its development.

I need you to:
Analyze whether the original logic of the specification is being followed.
Analyze whether there are any differences in functionality.
Analyze whether there is any incorrect/erroneous functionality.

Save the results of your analysis in a document named analysis-compare.md.
