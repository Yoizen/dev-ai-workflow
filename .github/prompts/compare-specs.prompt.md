Act as a Senior Software Architect and Technical Analyst.
I have attached two documents for your review:
system technical pdf-extracted.txt: The original technical specification proposed for the project's implementation.
doc-solution-logic.md: The documented logic of the actual developed solution.
Please perform a comprehensive comparative analysis between the two documents. Your analysis must strictly address the following key areas:
Logic Alignment: Analyze whether the fundamental logic, architecture, and constraints of the original specification are accurately being followed in the implementation.
Functional Discrepancies: Identify any differences in functionality. Are there missing features, unauthorized additions, or deviations between what was proposed and what was built?
Errors and Inconsistencies: Analyze the implemented logic to identify any incorrect, erroneous, or flawed functionality, either by contradicting the original spec or by introducing technical anti-patterns.
Output Requirements:
Structure your response using clear Markdown formatting (headings, bullet points, and tables if necessary).
Provide specific quotes or references from both documents to justify your findings.
Format your entire response as a single markdown code block so I can easily copy and save it as new-analysis-compare.md.
